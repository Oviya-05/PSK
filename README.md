# PSK
## Aim:
  To assess the performance of Phase-Shift Keying (PSK) modulation in digital communication systems under varying noise conditions.
## Tools required:

  * Colab (for executing Python code)
  * Libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib
    
## Program:
~~~
~~~

## Output Waveform:

## Results:
  * PSK successfully encoded data by changing the phase of the carrier signal.
  * It demonstrated good resistance to noise and maintained data integrity.
  * The modulation technique improved overall transmission efficiency.

The experiment confirmed PSK as an effective method for reliable digital communication.
